                The bomber jacket orginates from military clothing which trickled down into
                subcultures such as punk and has recently made its way to high fashion. First time was popular in Europe
                and gradually widely marketed for commercial consumer.

                A sweater (North American English) or pullover, also called a jumper (British English and Australian
                English),is a piece of clothing, typically with long sleeves, made of knitted or crocheted material,
                that covers the upper part of the body. When sleeveless, the garment is often called a slipover or
                sweater vest.

                Sweaters are worn by adults and children, often over a shirt, blouse, T-shirt, or another top, but
                sometimes next to the skin. Sweaters were traditionally made from wool but can now be made of cotton,
                synthetic fibers, or any combination of these. There are also seasonal sweaters.
